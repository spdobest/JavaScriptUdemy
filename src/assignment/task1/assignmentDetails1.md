# Assignment 1
## Its a basic assignment to understand the operators, variable and constants and datatype use.
- Create two variables
    - one that holds a fictional user input (a number of your choice)
    - Another that holds no value initially(e.g result)
- Set the result variable to 18 plus the value stored in user input
- Add the additional lines of code where you change the result variable again( by substracting a value of your choice, multiplying it and dividing it)
- Think about the value stored in the user input variable you also created - did that value change ?
- alert() the result and the user input variable (in two separate alert() calls)
