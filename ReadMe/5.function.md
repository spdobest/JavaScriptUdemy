# Functions
## Different ways of creating Functions
- Anonymous Functions
- Callaback Functions & Functions in Functions
- Default Arguments & Rest Operator
- bind() & apply()
  
## Function Definition  
- Functions are Code in demand.
- Variables and constants created in functions belong to that function.
- Functions can take parameters(Arguments) and can return a value.
- FUnctions can be called multiple times(with different arguments).
- Functions can be called directly or indirectly.
- we can call a function on button click like this.
- ```
        function startGame(){
            console.log("Start Game");
        }

     button.addEventListener('click',startGame);   
   ```
- We can defined function inside a object
- ```
    const person = {
        greet: function greet(){
            console.log("Hello ther...")
        }
    };
    ```
## Parameters Vs Argument
- Throughout this course, you'll hear me use the words "parameters" and "arguments" interchangeably.
- Technically, there is a difference though:
- Parameters are these variables which you specify between parentheses when defining a function.
```function sayHi(name) { ... } ```
- In this example, name is a **parameter**.
- Arguments then are the concrete values you pass to a function when calling that function:
- ```sayHi('Siba');```
- 'Siba' is an **argument** of the function therefore - for the name parameter to be precise.
- Since both concepts obviously are extremely close connected, I will often say "let's define which arguments a function receives" or something comparable, since defining the arguments of a function in the end means that you set up its parameters (and vice-versa).
## Function Vs Method
- You can store functions as argument in Javascript Object.
```
const Person = {
name:'Siba',
  greet: function greet(){
    console.log('Hello...'+this.name );
  }
}
```
- If we define this method outside object, then this is known as function
- If we define any function as argument inside object is known as methods
- For example follow **1functionVsMethods** 
 ## Functions are objects
 - if you type like this
```
    console.log(typeof startGame)
 ```   
## Functions can be stored in constant as well
```
    const start = function startGame(){
            console.log("Start Game");
        }

   console.log(start);     
```

- **[Follow this Link for More Details about Anonymous Function](https://www.javatpoint.com/javascript-anonymous-functions)
- Here we can not use startGame function above  
- we can use constant start instead  
- We can write the function first and call it later or first call the function and then write the function  
## Function Expression Vs Function Declaration
<img src="https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/blob/master/ReadMe/images/functionDefinationVsDeclaration.png" width="700" height="400" />

## Function Declaration/ Function Statement
```
    function multiply(a,b){
            return a*b;
        }
```

- Hoisted to top, can be declared anywhere in the file (i.e also after its used)

### Function Expression

```
    const multiply = function(a,b){
            return a*b;
        }
```

- Hoisted to top but not initalized/ defined, can't be declared anywhere in the file (i.e not after its used)

## Anonymous Function
```
     const start = function(){
            console.log("Start Game");
        };
    startButton.addEventListener('click',start);

     startButton.addEventListener('click',function(){
         // write code here
     });   
```
-  In the second approach above, we no need to store the function in a constants
## Arrow FUnction
- Its one type of anonymous function
- ```
    const arrowFUnction = (params1, params2) =>{
        // function body
    };  
  ```
-  You can make the short like below as well
- ```
        const multiply = (arg1,arg2) => { arg1*arg2}
   ```

## Different Arrow Function Syntax
- For arrow functions, you got a couple of different syntaxes which you can use - here's a summary.
- **Important:** Don't miss the "function only returns an object" special case at the end of this article!
- **1) Default syntax:**
```
const add = (a, b) => {
    const result = a + b;
    return result; // like in "normal" functions, parameters and return statement are OPTIONAL!
};
```
- **Noteworthy:** Semi-colon at end, no function keyword, parentheses around parameters/ arguments.
- **2) Shorter parameter syntax**, if exactly one parameter is received:
```
const log = message => {
    console.log(message); // could also return something of course - this example just doesn't
};
```
- **Noteworthy:** Parentheses around parameter list can be omitted (for exactly one argument).
- **3) Empty parameter** parentheses if NO arguments are received:
```
const greet = () => {
    console.log('Hi there!');
};
```
- **Noteworthy:** Parentheses have to be added (can't be omitted)
- **4) Shorter function body**, if exactly one expression is used:
```const add = (a, b) => a + b;```
- **Noteworthy:** Curly braces and return statement can be omitted, expression result is always returned automatically
- **5) Function returns** an object (with shortened syntax as shown in 4)):
- ```const loadPerson = pName => ({name: pName });```
- **Noteworthy:** Extra parentheses are required around the object, since the curly braces would otherwise be interpreted as the function body delimiters (and hence a syntax error would be thrown here).
- That last case can be confusing: Normally, in JavaScript, curly braces always can have exactly one meaning.
- ```const person = { name: 'Max' };``` // Clearly creates an object
- ```if (something) { ... }``` // Clearly used to mark the if statement block
- But when using arrow functions, curly braces can have two meanings:
    - 1) Mark the function body (in default form)
    - 2) Create an object which you want to return (in shorter function body form)
    - To "tell" JavaScript what you want to do, wrap the expression (e.g. object creation) in parentheses like shown above.
## Default Arguments in Functions
- ```
        function multiply(num1 = 0,num2 = 0){
            return num1*num2;
        }
        console.log(multiply());

  ```

## REST Operator in javascript (Multiple Operator)
  - if you are not sure how many parameters can be passed to a funcion argument
  - in this situation we can use rest operator with ...
  - ```
        const sumUp = (...numbers) =>{
            let sum = 0;
            for(const num of numbers){
                sum += num;
            }
            return sum
        };

        console.log(sumUp(1,2,3,3,534));
        console.log(sumUp(1,2));

        const sumUpOther = (a,b,...numbers) =>{
            let sum = 0;
            for(const num of numbers){
                sum += num;
            }
            return sum
        };
    ```

## Spread operator
- Spread operator allows an iterable to expand in places where 0+ arguments are expected. 
- It is mostly used in the variable array where there is more than 1 values are expected. 
- It allows us the privilege to obtain a list of parameters from an array. 
- Syntax of Spread operator is same as Rest parameter but it works completely opposite of it.
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax
- ```
  let arr = [1,2,3];
  let arr2 = [4,5];

  arr = arr.concat(arr2);

  console.log(arr); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
  ``` 
- We can get the result using spread operator
- ```
  // spread operator doing the concat job
  let arr = [1,2,3];
  let arr2 = [4,5];

  arr = [...arr,...arr2];
  console.log(arr); // [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
  ```
## Function inside another function
- we can define another arrow or anonmous function inside another.
- Here is the example
- ```
     const sumUp = (...numbers) =>{
         const validateNumber = (number) = {
             return isNan(number) ? 0 : number;
         }
            let sum = 0;
            for(const num of numbers){
                sum += validateNumber(num);
            }
            return sum
        };
  ```

  ## Call Back Function
  - A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.
 ```
        function myDisplayer(some) {
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = some;
        }

        function myCalculator(num1, num2, myCallback) {
          let sum = num1 + num2;
          myCallback(sum);
        }

        myCalculator(5, 5, myDisplayer);
  ```     
  - when we pass a function as a argument to a another function
  - here is the example
```
        const sumUp = (resultHandler,...numbers) =>{
         const validateNumber = (number) = {
             return isNan(number) ? 0 : number;
         }
            let sum = 0;
            for(const num of numbers){
                sum += validateNumber(num);
            }
            return resultHandler(sum)
        };

        const resultHandler = (sum) =>{
            alert('Sum is '+sum);
        }

```

## bind
- The bind() method returns a new function, when invoked, has its this sets to a specific value.
- Bind creates a new function that will force the this inside the function to be the parameter passed to bind().
- 
- ```
  fn.bind(thisArg[, arg1[, arg2[, ...]]])
  ``` 
- In this syntax, the bind() method returns a copy of the function **fn** with the specific this value (thisArg) and arguments (arg1, arg2, â€¦).
  

- This is used for future execution
- In the below example, you can see we pass message parameter in the bind method, which will be execute once the result come out
- Follow **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/functions-11-bind-finished**
- Same example for Calculator application **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/functions-revisited**
> Unlike the call() and apply() methods, the bind() method doesnâ€™t immediately execute the function. It just returns a new version of the function whose this sets to thisArg argument.
## call() and apply()
- With the **apply()** method, you can write a method that can be used on different objects.
```
var person = {
  fullName: function() {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
  }
}
var person1 = {
  firstName: "Mary",
  lastName: "Doe"
}
person.fullName.apply(person1);  // Will return "Mary Doe"
```
## Use of call
```
var pokemon = {
    firstname: 'Pika',
    lastname: 'Chu ',
    getPokeName: function() {
        var fullname = this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname;
        return fullname;
    }
};

var pokemonName = function(snack, hobby) {
    console.log(this.getPokeName() + ' loves ' + snack + ' and ' + hobby);
};

pokemonName.call(pokemon,'sushi', 'algorithms'); // Pika Chu  loves sushi and algorithms
pokemonName.apply(pokemon,['sushi', 'algorithms']); // Pika Chu  loves sushi and algorithms
```
- Call and apply works in same way. the only difference is, while calling call, we need to pass parameters one by one, but in apply we have to pass parameters in array.
- With the **call()** method, you can write a method that can be used on different objects.
```
var person = {
  fullName: function(city, country) {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + "," + city + "," + country;
  }
}
var person1 = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName: "Doe"
}
person.fullName.call(person1, "Oslo", "Norway");
```

## bind()
- The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the provided value. (It actually talks about even more stuff, but weâ€™ll leave that for another time :) )
```
var pokemon = {
    firstname: 'Pika',
    lastname: 'Chu ',
    getPokeName: function() {
        var fullname = this.firstname + ' ' + this.lastname;
        return fullname;
    }
};

var pokemonName = function() {
    console.log(this.getPokeName() + 'I choose you!');
};

var logPokemon = pokemonName.bind(pokemon); // creates new object and binds pokemon. 'this' of pokemon === pokemon now

logPokemon(); // 'Pika Chu I choose you!'
```

## Difference between apply() and call()
- The call() method takes arguments separately.
- The apply() method takes arguments as an array.
