# Async And HTTP

- What is Async Code ?
- Working with Callbacks
- Promises
- async/await

## What is Async Code ?

- JS is single threaded
- JS can only execute one task at a time.
- Code executes step by step in order.
- IN general Javascript executes the code step by step.
- Lets asume if there is few code like this

```
console.log('Initial Code');
// fetch data from network
// other operation
```

- In the above case if the second step takes time to fetch data from server, then the 3rd operations need to wait.
- For that we have to write in such a way that it will execute the second step and also continue execute the 3rd task

## we can do this using callback

```
const button = document.querySelector('button');
const output = document.querySelector('p');

function trackUserHandler() {
  console.log('Clicked!');
}

button.addEventListener('click', trackUserHandler);
```
