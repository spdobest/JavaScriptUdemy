# Objects

## What's an Object ?
- Objects are something which contains data.
- Object have hafe functions and variables
- It can contain any datatypes that are valid in javascript

## Objects & Priitive Values
- Objects are reference values - you learned that.
- It might not have been obvious yet but it's also important to recognize that, in the end, objects are of course made up of primitive values.
- **Here's an example:**
```
const complexPerson = {
    name: 'Max',
    hobbies: ['Sports', 'Cooking'],
    address: {
        street: 'Some Street 5',
        stateId: 5,
        country: 'Germany',
        phone: {
            number: 12 345 678 9,
            isMobile: true
        }
    },
};
```
- Event though complexPerson has multiple nested reference values (nested arrays and objects), you end up with primitive values if you drill into the object.
- name holds a string ('Max') => Primitive value
- hobbies holds an array (i.e. a reference value) which is full of strings ('Sports', 'Cooking') => Primitive values
- address holds an object which in turn holds a mixture of primitive values like 'Some Street 5' and nested objects (phone), but if you dive into phone, you find only numbers and booleans in there => Primitive values
- So you could say: Primitive values are the core building blocks that hold your data, objects (and arrays) are helpful for organizing and working with that data.

## Objects - Recap
- We can create an object like this
```
const Person = {
    name: 'Siba',
    age: 31,
    hobbies: ['Cricket','Reading','listening music'],
    greet: function() {
        console.log('Hello')
    }
};
```
## Adding, Modifying & Deleting Properties
- **Adding property to the object**
- There are two approach to add a new property to an object, 
    - 1. Create a new object with the new property you want to add (This is more complex and not feasible at all)
    - 2. In second approach just assign a new value to the object, it will create a new property
    ```
        let person = {
            name: 'Siba',
            age: 31,
            hobbies: ['Cricket','Reading','listening music'],
            greet: function() {
                console.log('Hello')
            }
        };
        person.isAdmin = true;
    ```
    - If you print person.isAdmin before adding a preoperty, it will print undefined
- **Deleting Property**
    - You can delete a property from an object by using the delete keyword like this
    - ``` delete person.age;```    
    - cnsole.log(person.age); // it will print undefined
    - You can delete any property by assigning undefined to the property
    - But this is not the way to do.
    - After deleting the property if you print the person object it willl print the age included object. But the value is undefined
## Difference between undefined and null
- Undefined means the property does not exist in the object
- Null means the property is there in the object but the value got cleared

## Special Key Names & Square Bracket Property Access
- In javascript only string values are allowed as property name
- first name , first-name, these property names are not allowed
- To achieve this we can use string as property
```
const person = {
    'first name': 'Sibaprasad',
    age: 31,
    'last-name': 'Mohanty'
}
// how to access the property
person['first name']
```
- As you can see the above example we can access the property using the square bracket.

## Property Types & Property Order
- You can use number (Only positive number and float) as property of object
- Javascript convert all the property name to string then access it internally
- const person = {
    1.5 = "siba",
    age = 123
    1 = "prasad"
};
- Once you will print this, it will print the values in the console as the proerties are showing in the above object
- If you expand the object in the console, it will show as shorted by key name
- In the above example it will ```{1: "prasad",1.5: "siba", age:123}```
- To access these properties use swuare bracket like this 
```
    person.1.5// it will show compile time error
    person[1.5] // internally javascript do like this person['1.5']
    person[1]
```
```
const person = {
    5 : 'Siba',
    3 : 'prasad'
    1 : 'moh'
};
console.log(person); // {1: 'moh',3: 'prasad', 5: 'Siba'}
```
- If all the property names are numbers, then while print it will short the array then print in the console

## Dynamic Property Access & Setting Properties Dynamically
- For more details look at the JS programs
- **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-05-dynamic-access-and-assignment**
## Object Properties
- 
## Demo App & Shirthand Property Syntax
```
const btn = document.getElementById('button-name');
const title = document.getElementById('title').value;
const desc = document.getElementById('description').value;
const extra = document.getElementById('extra').value;
```
- If the property name and the value will be same you no need to declare key and value like below
```
const newMovie = {
    title: title,
    desc: desc,
    extra: extra
}
```
- Instead of this you can write like this, as the key and value name are same
```
const newMovie = {
    title,
    desc,
    extra
}
```
- For more Details please follow the codes **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-07-rendering-movies**

## Rendering Elements based on Objects
- We can create element to store the elem in the lentsist
- In this example we are adding movies to a moviesList and showing in the list
- For the example follow **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-07-rendering-movies**

## For-in Loops & Outputting Dynamic Properties
```
for(item in items){
    // code to do the operation with the item in the list
}
```
## Adding the filter Functionality
```
const filteredMovies = movies.filter(movie =>{
    movie.infludes('searchedMovie');
})
```
- It will filtered out the movies which match the searched movie name
- For more details please look into the code **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-09-search-functionality***

## Understanding Chaining (Property & Method chaining)
- We can access properties with the help of chaining like this
- const id = Math.random().toString();
- In the above line we are chaining the methods in one line 
## The Object Spread operator
- Though we already discussed **spread** operator in Array before. We can use this operator in object as well
- Lets consider a object person
```
const person = {name: 'Siba',age: 30, hobbies: ['Sports','Cooking']}
```
- If we want to copy this value to another we can do like this
- const anotherPerson = person
- In this case, the reference is same as person. 
- person.age = 31, then anotherPerson.age = 31. Because anotherPerson variable holds the reference of person object only
- TO avoid this issue we can use spread operator here
- const person2 = {...person};
- person.age= 33; but person2.age is 30.
- In the above case, this will copy all the properties and create another object and assign to person2
- Its applicable to all the properties except the reference type array (here hobbies)
- person.hobbies.push('coding');
- person.hobbies = ['Sports','Cooking','coding']
- Now person2 also contains the same array that in person object
- person2.hobbies = ['Sports','Cooking','coding']

- Spread operator only applicable to top level properties, its not applicable to the nested object like above hobbiers
- const person3 = {...person, age: 20, hobbies:[...person.hobbies]};
## Understanding Object.assign()
- ANother way of assigning/ copying the object by using **assign**
- const person = {name:'Sibaprasad'}
- const person2 = Object.assign({},person);
- {} means it create another empty object and copy the properties in the person object
- now person.name = 'prasad'
- but person2.name is same 'Sibaprasad'
