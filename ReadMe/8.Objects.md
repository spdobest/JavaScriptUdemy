# Objects

## What's an Object ?
- Objects are something which contains data.
- Object have hafe functions and variables
- It can contain any datatypes that are valid in javascript

## Objects & Priitive Values
- Objects are reference values - you learned that.
- It might not have been obvious yet but it's also important to recognize that, in the end, objects are of course made up of primitive values.
- **Here's an example:**
```
const complexPerson = {
    name: 'Max',
    hobbies: ['Sports', 'Cooking'],
    address: {
        street: 'Some Street 5',
        stateId: 5,
        country: 'Germany',
        phone: {
            number: 12 345 678 9,
            isMobile: true
        }
    },
};
```
- Event though complexPerson has multiple nested reference values (nested arrays and objects), you end up with primitive values if you drill into the object.
- name holds a string ('Max') => Primitive value
- hobbies holds an array (i.e. a reference value) which is full of strings ('Sports', 'Cooking') => Primitive values
- address holds an object which in turn holds a mixture of primitive values like 'Some Street 5' and nested objects (phone), but if you dive into phone, you find only numbers and booleans in there => Primitive values
- So you could say: Primitive values are the core building blocks that hold your data, objects (and arrays) are helpful for organizing and working with that data.
