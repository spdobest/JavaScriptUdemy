# Objects

## What's an Object ?
- Objects are something which contains data.
- Object have hafe functions and variables
- It can contain any datatypes that are valid in javascript

## Objects & Priitive Values
- Objects are reference values - you learned that.
- It might not have been obvious yet but it's also important to recognize that, in the end, objects are of course made up of primitive values.
- **Here's an example:**
```
const complexPerson = {
    name: 'Max',
    hobbies: ['Sports', 'Cooking'],
    address: {
        street: 'Some Street 5',
        stateId: 5,
        country: 'Germany',
        phone: {
            number: 12 345 678 9,
            isMobile: true
        }
    },
};
```
- Event though complexPerson has multiple nested reference values (nested arrays and objects), you end up with primitive values if you drill into the object.
- name holds a string ('Max') => Primitive value
- hobbies holds an array (i.e. a reference value) which is full of strings ('Sports', 'Cooking') => Primitive values
- address holds an object which in turn holds a mixture of primitive values like 'Some Street 5' and nested objects (phone), but if you dive into phone, you find only numbers and booleans in there => Primitive values
- So you could say: Primitive values are the core building blocks that hold your data, objects (and arrays) are helpful for organizing and working with that data.

## Objects - Recap
- We can create an object like this
```
const Person = {
    name: 'Siba',
    age: 31,
    hobbies: ['Cricket','Reading','listening music'],
    greet: function() {
        console.log('Hello')
    }
};
```
## Adding, Modifying & Deleting Properties
- **Adding property to the object**
- There are two approach to add a new property to an object, 
    - 1. Create a new object with the new property you want to add (This is more complex and not feasible at all)
    - 2. In second approach just assign a new value to the object, it will create a new property
    ```
        let person = {
            name: 'Siba',
            age: 31,
            hobbies: ['Cricket','Reading','listening music'],
            greet: function() {
                console.log('Hello')
            }
        };
        person.isAdmin = true;
    ```
    - If you print person.isAdmin before adding a preoperty, it will print undefined
- **Deleting Property**
    - You can delete a property from an object by using the delete keyword like this
    - ``` delete person.age;```    
    - cnsole.log(person.age); // it will print undefined
    - You can delete any property by assigning undefined to the property
    - But this is not the way to do.
    - After deleting the property if you print the person object it willl print the age included object. But the value is undefined
## Difference between undefined and null
- Undefined means the property does not exist in the object
- Null means the property is there in the object but the value got cleared

## Special Key Names & Square Bracket Property Access
- In javascript only string values are allowed as property name
- first name , first-name, these property names are not allowed
- To achieve this we can use string as property
```
const person = {
    'first name': 'Sibaprasad',
    age: 31,
    'last-name': 'Mohanty'
}
// how to access the property
person['first name']
```
- As you can see the above example we can access the property using the square bracket.

## Property Types & Property Order
- You can use number (Only positive number and float) as property of object
- Javascript convert all the property name to string then access it internally
- const person = {
    1.5 = "siba",
    age = 123
    1 = "prasad"
};
- Once you will print this, it will print the values in the console as the proerties are showing in the above object
- If you expand the object in the console, it will show as shorted by key name
- In the above example it will ```{1: "prasad",1.5: "siba", age:123}```
- To access these properties use swuare bracket like this 
```
    person.1.5// it will show compile time error
    person[1.5] // internally javascript do like this person['1.5']
    person[1]
```
```
const person = {
    5 : 'Siba',
    3 : 'prasad'
    1 : 'moh'
};
console.log(person); // {1: 'moh',3: 'prasad', 5: 'Siba'}
```
- If all the property names are numbers, then while print it will short the array then print in the console
-
## Dynamic Property Access & Setting Properties Dynamically
- For more details look at the JS programs
- **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-05-dynamic-access-and-assignment**
## Object Properties
- 
## Demo App & Shirthand Property Syntax
```
const btn = document.getElementById('button-name');
const title = document.getElementById('title').value;
const desc = document.getElementById('description').value;
const extra = document.getElementById('extra').value;
```
- If the property name and the value will be same you no need to declare key and value like below
```
const newMovie = {
    title: title,
    desc: desc,
    extra: extra
}
```
- Instead of this you can write like this, as the key and value name are same
```
const newMovie = {
    title,
    desc,
    extra
}
```
- For more Details please follow the codes **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-07-rendering-movies**

## Rendering Elements based on Objects
- We can create element to store the elem in the lentsist
- In this example we are adding movies to a moviesList and showing in the list
- For the example follow **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-07-rendering-movies**

## For-in Loops & Outputting Dynamic Properties
```
for(item in items){
    // code to do the operation with the item in the list
}
```
## Adding the filter Functionality
```
const filteredMovies = movies.filter(movie =>{
    movie.infludes('searchedMovie');
})
```
- It will filtered out the movies which match the searched movie name
- For more details please look into the code **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-09-search-functionality***

## Understanding Chaining (Property & Method chaining)
- We can access properties with the help of chaining like this
- const id = Math.random().toString();
- In the above line we are chaining the methods in one line 
## The Object Spread operator
- Though we already discussed **spread** operator in Array before. We can use this operator in object as well
- Lets consider a object person
```
const person = {name: 'Siba',age: 30, hobbies: ['Sports','Cooking']}
```
- If we want to copy this value to another we can do like this
- const anotherPerson = person
- In this case, the reference is same as person. 
- person.age = 31, then anotherPerson.age = 31. Because anotherPerson variable holds the reference of person object only
- TO avoid this issue we can use spread operator here
- const person2 = {...person};
- person.age= 33; but person2.age is 30.
- In the above case, this will copy all the properties and create another object and assign to person2
- Its applicable to all the properties except the reference type array (here hobbies)
- person.hobbies.push('coding');
- person.hobbies = ['Sports','Cooking','coding']
- Now person2 also contains the same array that in person object
- person2.hobbies = ['Sports','Cooking','coding']

- Spread operator only applicable to top level properties, its not applicable to the nested object like above hobbiers
- const person3 = {...person, age: 20, hobbies:[...person.hobbies]};
## Understanding Object.assign()
- ANother way of assigning/ copying the object by using **assign**
- const person = {name:'Sibaprasad'}
- const person2 = Object.assign({},person);
- {} means it create another empty object and copy the properties in the person object
- now person.name = 'prasad'
- but person2.name is same 'Sibaprasad'
## Object Destructuring
- You can destructuring Javascript objects
-  for example please look into the code here **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-10-destructuring**
- In the object.js under javascript folder
```
filteredMovies.forEach(movie => {
    const movieEl = document.createElement('li');
    const { info, ...otherProps } = movie;
    console.log(otherProps);
    const { title: movieTitle } = info;
    let text = movieTitle + ' - ';
    for (const key in info) {
      if (key !== 'title') {
        text = text + `${key}: ${info[key]}`;
      }
    }
    movieEl.textContent = text;
    movieList.append(movieEl);
  });
};
```
- Look at the code snippet above to understand the object destructuring.
## Checking for Property Existance in Object
- Sometime you will get javascript object dynamically, that time its difficult to know th e key contained in the object
- To avoid this, we can first check the key is exists in the object or not then do the operation.
```if('info' in movieObject){
    // do the operation
    const movieInfo = movieObject.info
} 
```
- In another way you can check, by checking the property not equal to undefined.
## Introducing this
```
const newMovie = {
    info: {
        title,
        [extraName] : exraName
    },
    id: Math.random().toString(),
    getFOrmattedTitle: function(){
        return this.info.title.toUpperCase();
    }
}
```
- In the above method , this means pointing to the current object.
- For example **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-11-introducing-this**
## The method shorthand syntax
- In the above example, you can ommit the function keyword 
- THis is another shorthand of the function 
```
getFOrmattedTitle(){
        return this.info.title.toUpperCase();
    }
```
## The this keyword and its strange Behavior
- To avoid the error, we can use bind method by passing the object as argument.
- For example **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-12-this-and-bind**
- Bind() prepares a function for future executions
## call() & apply()
- ``` const title = getFormatttedTitle.call(movie);```
- In the above method, the call keywords run the methods as soon as it required Not like bind method.
- We can use apply in case of call method as well
- call takes extra parameter with the this
- apply takes 2 parameters 1. for this object and rest are in an array
- For Example **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-13-call-and-apply**
## What the Browser does to "this"
```
const newMovie = {
    info: {
        title,
        [extraName] : exraName
    },
    id: Math.random().toString(),
    getFOrmattedTitle =  () => {
        console.log(this);
        return this.info.title.toUpperCase();
    }
}
```
- In the above case, this will not pointing to the newMovue Object
- It is pointing to the object from where its called
- It will show error, as this.info is null
## "this" & Arrow function
- For Arrow function example follow **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-14-this-and-arrow-functions**
## "this" summary 
- The this keyword can lead to some headaches in JavaScript - this summary hopefully acts as a remedy.
this refers to different things, depending on where it's used and how (if used in a function) a function is called.
- Generally, this refers to the "thing" which called a function (if used inside of a function). That can be the global context, an object or some bound data/ object (e.g. when the browser binds this to the button that triggered a click event).
- 1) this in Global Context (i.e. outside of any function)
```
function something() { ... }
```
- console.log(this); // logs global object (window in browser) - ALWAYS (also in strict mode)!
- 2) this in a Function (non-Arrow) - Called in the global context
```
function something() { 
    console.log(this);
}
something(); // logs global object (window in browser) in non-strict mode, undefined in strict mode
```
- 3) this in an Arrow-Function - Called in the global context
```
const something = () => { 
    console.log(this);
}
something(); // logs global object (window in browser) - ALWAYS (also in strict mode)!
```
- 4) this in a Method (non-Arrow) - Called on an object
```
const person = { 
    name: 'Max',
    greet: function() { // or use method shorthand: greet() { ... }
        console.log(this.name);
    }
};
 
person.greet(); // logs 'Max', "this" refers to the person object
```
- 5) this in a Method (Arrow Function) - Called on an object
```
const person = { 
    name: 'Max',
    greet: () => {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
};
```
- person.greet(); // logs nothing (or some global name on window object), "this" refers to global (window) object, even in strict mode
- this can refer to unexpected things if you call it on some other object, e.g.:
```
const person = { 
    name: 'Max',
    greet() {
        console.log(this.name);
    }
};
 
const anotherPerson = { name: 'Manuel' }; // does NOT have a built-in greet method!
 
anotherPerson.sayHi = person.greet; // greet is NOT called here, it's just assigned to a new property/ method on the "anotherPerson" object
 
anotherPerson.sayHi(); // logs 'Manuel' because method is called on "anotherPerson" object => "this" refers to the "thing" which called it
```
- If in doubt, a console.log(this); can always help you find out what this is referring to at the moment!
## Getters & Setters
- For example follow **https://github.com/spdobest/JavaScriptUdemy/tree/master/src/objects-15-getters-setters**
